# AUTH APP

USER REGISTRATION USING FIREBASE & VITE@REACT

The identification of the users of an app is necessary in most cases if they want to access all its features.

Firebase offers an authentication system that allows both the registration itself (by email and password) and the use of access profiles from other external platforms (for example, from Facebook, Google or Twitter), a very convenient alternative for reluctant users. to complete the process.

Thus, these types of tasks are simplified, also considering that access is managed from here and greater security and data protection is achieved. It should be mentioned that Firebase can save login details in the cloud in complete security, preventing a person from having to identify themselves every time they open the application.

Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication systems easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for end users. It provides an end-to-end identity solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub login, and more.
